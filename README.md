# Purpose
The purpose for this exercise is to gain hands on practice on data mining coding with machine learning. Such transferable skills can be applied to healthcare settings.
(Due to HIPAA regulation, no actual project relatede data would be used in this practice)

## Classfication
Three models are used in classification:
### Deep learning based models
I constructed multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch.
### Support vector machine (SVM)
I deployed this model using scikit-learn.

## Clustering
### K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Spectral Clustering
I deployed these three models using scikit-learn.
